On UI restart, the extension will try to download the compiled Vue app from
Github. Check whether `stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-openpose-editor\dist`
exists and has content in it. 

Some users in China have reported having issue downloading dist with the autoupdate
script. In such situtations, the user has 2 following options to get dist
manually:

### Option1: Build the application 
Make sure you have nodeJS environment ready and follow `Development` section.
Run `npm run build` to compile the application.

### Option2: Download the compiled application
You can download the compiled application(`dist.zip`) from the 
[release](https://github.com/huchenlei/sd-webui-openpose-editor/releases) page. 
Unzip the package in the repository root and make sure hte unziped directory is 
named `dist`.

# Usage
The openpose editor core is build with Vue3. The gradio extension script is 
a thin wrapper that mounts the Vue3 Application on `/openpose_editor_index`.

The user can directly access the editor at `localhost:7860/openpose_editor_index` 
or `https://huchenlei.github.io/sd-webui-openpose-editor/` 
if desired, but the main entry point is invoking the editor in the ControlNet 
extension. In ControlNet extension, select any openpose preprocessor, and hit
the run preprocessor button. A preprocessor result preview will be genereated.
Click `Edit` button at the bottom right corner of the generated image will bring
up the openpose editor in a modal. After the edit, clicking the 
`Send pose to ControlNet` button will send back the pose to ControlNet.

Following demo shows the basic workflow:

# Features
1. Support for face/hand used in controlnet.
    - The extension recognizes the face/hand objects in the controlnet preprocess
    results.
    - The user can add face/hand if the preprocessor result misses them. It can
    be done by either
        - Add Default hand (Face is not supported as face has too many keypoints (70 keypoints),
        which makes adjust them manually really hard.)
        - Add the object by uploading a pose JSON. The corresponding object of
        the first person will be used.
1. Visibility toggle
    - If a keypoint is not recognized by ControlNet preprocessor, it will have
    `(-1, -1)` as coordinates. Such invalid keypoints will be set as invisible 
    in the editor.
    - If the user sets a keypoint as invisible and send the pose back to 
    controlnet, the limb segments that the keypoint connects will not be rendered.
    Effectively this is how you remove a limb segment in the editor.
1. Group toggle
    - If you don't want to accidentally select and modify the keypoint of an 
    canvas object (hand/face/body). You can group them. The grouped object will
    act like it is a single object. You can scale, rotate, skew the group.

# Development
## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
